## Example 1: ☕️ The First Cup: Should you even be a PM right now?

We opened last week with a punchy X thread questioning whether product management was a ZIRP-era luxury. The thread suggested that roles like PM and consulting—often detached from hard ROI—might be in a slow decline, especially with AI accelerating the trend.

**Key takeaway:** The PM role is evolving. If your value stops at “prioritizing tickets,” you’re vulnerable. But if you’re the person clarifying the problem and shaping the solution, you’re still essential.

## Example 2: ☕️ First Cup: Figma Make & the Rise of Instant UX

Fast. Beautiful. Misleading?This week’s First Cup tackled the buzz—and the backlash—around **Figma Make** and the rise of instant prototyping tools. Are they changing how we work, or just making chaos look slick?Here’s what we heard:

  * Valerie King says it’s **progress, not sacrilege** —but only if PM and UX align on the “why” before the wireframes.
  * Edie Kirkman warned that fast tools can **invite bad assumptions** and “marry” stakeholders to ideas that aren’t ready for reality.
  * Steve Johnson called it “chaos with a pretty AI.” The risk? Beautiful fakery that bypasses strategy and sets delivery traps.
  * Brian Huss from PrizePicks reminded us that **speed isn’t the goal—validation is**. These tools help us test _real reactions_ faster, not just prettier pixels.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Instant UX isn't a shortcut. It's a multiplier. But only when cross-functional teams use it to **test strategy—not replace it**.

## Example 3: ☕️ First Cup: PM or Prototype Machine?

Should PMs vibe-code their way into better collaboration—or is this just another distraction from real product work?That was the spicy prompt that kicked off last week’s First Cup, where Saeed Khan unpacked his now-viral post warning product leaders: **we're piling too much delivery work on top of already overloaded PMs.** His hot take? _“We shouldn’t keep adding to the plate. Our job is to drive business value.”_  
**But not everyone agreed.** Diamonde Henderson countered with conviction: _“Vibe coding is communication. It’s how we build clarity, faster—and avoid costly misunderstandings later.”_ And Nandu Shah reminded us that prototyping today looks a lot like strategic sketching did in the early days of Google. The tools have changed. The point hasn’t.  
**🔥 Key Takeaway:** Whether you vibe-code or just vibe-check the tech, every PM needs clarity on this: _are you building value, or just building?_
