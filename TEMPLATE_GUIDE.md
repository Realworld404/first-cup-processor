## üîß What Gets Replaced

### `{{HOOK}}`
AI generates an engaging 2-3 sentence intro about the panel discussion topic.

**Example:**
```
Ever wonder how AI agents will reshape your business in 2025? In this First Cup panel, we explore the practical applications, real costs, and surprising limitations of AI automation. Our experts break down what's hype and what's actually working right now.
```

### `{{KEY_TOPICS}}`
AI generates 3-5 bullet points about what's discussed.

**Example:**
```
‚Ä¢ The difference between AI tools and true AI agents
‚Ä¢ Real-world cost analysis: When automation actually saves money
‚Ä¢ Common mistakes businesses make when implementing AI
‚Ä¢ Practical framework for deciding what to automate first
‚Ä¢ The human skills that become MORE valuable with AI
```

### `{{TIMESTAMPS}}`
AI extracts timestamps from your transcript.

**Example:**

```

## üö® Important Notes

### Placeholder Names
Use EXACTLY these placeholder names:
- `{{HOOK}}`
- `{{KEY_TOPICS}}`
- `{{TIMESTAMPS}}`
- `{{KEYWORDS}}`

(Case-sensitive, double curly braces)

### Keywords Format
Keywords are now **comma-separated, NO hashtags**.

**OLD** ‚ùå: `#AI #productivity #business`
**NEW** ‚úÖ: `AI, productivity, business automation, workflow`

This is better for YouTube's algorithm!

### Line Breaks
The template preserves your formatting, so:
- Use blank lines where you want spacing
- Structure sections with line breaks
- Add visual separators (---, ===, etc.)

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Template not found" warning
The script will use a basic default template. To fix:
1. Create `youtube_description_template.txt`
2. Place it in your transcripts folder OR current directory
3. Or specify path: `python3 youtube_processor.py watch_dir output_dir /path/to/template.txt`

### Placeholders not replaced
Check spelling: `{{HOOK}}` not `{{Hook}}` or `{HOOK}`

### Want different format
Edit the template! The script just replaces placeholders - everything else is yours to customize.

### Update existing episodes
The template only affects NEW processed episodes. To reprocess:
1. Remove filename from `.processed_transcripts.json`
2. Drop transcript again

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Version control your template** - Keep it in git so you can revert changes
2. **A/B test CTAs** - Try different calls-to-action and track which performs better
3. **Seasonal updates** - Update for holidays, events, product launches
4. **Guest templates** - Create special templates for guest appearances
5. **Series templates** - Different templates for different content series
